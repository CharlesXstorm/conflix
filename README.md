## üìú‚úç About The Project

Conflix is an extremely responsive Netflix clone built using MERN. I created this project to learn more about the MERN stack technology and to solidify my knowledge of best design and development practices.<br/>
I'm a professional designer/animator who has found his way into web development and this creative side of me tends to ensure that every design detail in development is represented accurately and properly.
<br/><br/>
This project is completely built from scratch without following any tutorial or copying any code abstraction from a similar base. It is 100% original, with the exception of the Conflix intro animation which is a modification of a Codepen by <a href="https://codepen.io/claudio_bonfati/pen/mdryxPv" target="_blank">Claudio Bonfati</a>.
<br/>
I added the ability to play some trailers at least, to give it the feel of a proper streaming service. I've also made improvements by adding micro-interactions and minimal page route transitions.
Most of the animations in this project were created using pure CSS, with a few exceptions that were made using Framer-motion.
<br/><br/>
I've put a great deal of work into this project, over 3 months and 2 weeks and I hope you'll like it as much as I do.<br/>
I would appreciate it if you could give this project a star, as a sign of encouragement. It will mean everything to know someone finds this project useful üòá.

### Guest Account

I've added a "signin as a guest" button for lazy users like me üòä. You don't need to signup to test the features of Conflix.
<br/>
There are a few restrictions attached to the guest account.
- It cannot delete the guest & kids sub-profile.
- It can add and edit other sub-profiles but cannot edit the guest & kids sub-profile.

## :hammer_and_wrench: :jigsaw: Challenges

My biggest challenge was the task I initially thought would be the easiest: the infinite scroll with the movie detail modal.<br/>
When I was mapping out tasks for the project, I brushed off the scroll task as something that would take a few minutes, but I was so wrong. This scroll feature isn't just any regular scroll implementation, it had to have some specialized features.
<br/><br/>
These features include:
<br/>
üü• Infinite scroll that moves by a particular scroll amount.<br/>
üü• Special modal that centrally overlays the element it highlights.<br/>
üü• Play the available trailer video when hovering over the modal.<br/>
üü• Detect if a scroll element is in the extreme right or left position.<br/>
üü• Expand the modal from the right or left with micro-interactions (depending on the scroll element's position).<br/>
üü• Detect if a movie is favourited, and dynamically render the appropriate add or remove button.<br/>
üü• Collapse the modal from the right or left with micro-interactions (depending on the scroll element's position).
